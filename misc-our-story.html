                    <h2>Founders</h2>
                    <p>Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, who share a 
                        long-time love for plants. Jason is the garden architect. He created and oversees all 
                        designs while managing his team of landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the 
                        company and oversees the nursery.

                    <h2>Mission & Values</h2>
                    <p>We believe that great gardens are built on harmony—between people, plants, and the environment. 
                       Our mission is to design sustainable, functional, and beautiful outdoor spaces that bring everyday joy. 
                       At the heart of our work are three core values: sustainability, using native plants and eco-conscious  
                       vision and lifestyle; and collaboration, working closely with every client from the initial concept 
                       through to completion to ensure every garden reflects a shared passion for nature.

                    <h2>Growth and Achievements</h2>
                    <p>From our small workshop in Tucson to a thriving design studio with a dedicated team of landscapers, 
                       horticulturists, and designers — our roots have grown deep. Over the years, we’ve helped transform 
                       residential courtyards, city rooftops, and community parks into lush, inviting environments. We’re 
                       proud to be known for our modern yet natural aesthetic — blending structure with softness, and artistry with practicality.
